# Mental Health Chatbot Assignment

This repository contains the implementation of a FastAPI server for a Mental Health Chatbot. The project includes two key functionalities: a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) endpoint and a classification endpoint. The aim is to assist users by suggesting relevant articles or blog posts based on their mental health queries and classifying data into appropriate categories.
